ABSTRACT

Mastitis poses a persistent challenge in dairy farming, impacting both economic viability and animal welfare significantly. This study aims to 1) identify genetic variants for mastitis development in dairy cows using genetic markers and 2) evaluate Machine learning methods for genomic prediction of mastitis. After quality control, 87,493 and 624,300 genetic variants were included in the analyses on 1,898 cows. The random forest model consists of an ensemble of decision trees, where each tree is trained on a bootstrap sample of the data and selects a random subset of features (SNPs) for splitting at each node. During prediction, the model aggregates the predictions of individual trees to make a final classification or regression decision, and the feature importance scores are calculated based on how much each feature contributes to reducing impurity across all trees.  Data compression techniques were utilized to efficiently handle the substantial size of the genomic datasets, followed by strategic oversampling to address class imbalance issues. The random forest method identified a subset of 202 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with significant impact on mastitis. The importance score was calculated by utilizing Gini impurity analysis. We then assigned a threshold value of 0.005 to the scores to determine which SNPs were the most significant. These SNPs were evaluated to predict mastitis with 69.6% accuracy. The random forest model, fine-tuned with optimized hyperparameters, demonstrates promising predictive abilities, achieving a peak accuracy of 72% and an average accuracy of 62% on the test set. Despite inherent challenges such as class imbalance and computational constraints, the efficacy of random forest highlights the potential of machine learning in mitigating diseases within the dairy sector. This study underscores the proactive stance of modern agriculture in embracing machine learning-driven solutions for disease management, emphasizing the connection between technological innovation and sustainable farming practices.
